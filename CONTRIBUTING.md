# Opening New Issues

Please log bugs or suggestions as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/pmem/libpmemobj-cpp/issues).
Details such as OS and PMDK version are always appreciated.

# Code Style

* See `.clang-format` file in the repository for details
* Indent with tabs (width: 8)
* Max 90 chars per line
* Space before '*' and '&' (rather than after)

If you want to check and format your source code properly you can use CMake's `DEVELOPER_MODE`
and `CHECK_CPP_STYLE` options. When enabled additional checks are switched on
(cppstyle, whitespace and license).

```sh
cmake .. -DDEVELOPER_MODE=ON -DCHECK_CPP_STYLE=ON
```

If you just want to format your code you can make adequate target:
```sh
make cppformat
```

**NOTE**: We're using specific clang-format - version exactly **9.0** is required.

## Doxygen documentation

* Each new feature should be documented using doxygen comment blocks.
* Each non-member function should be added to corresponding class documentation by `@relates` tag.
* Each new API should be assigned to group by `@ingroup` tag. See [groups definitions file](doc/groups_definitions.dox) in the repository for details.

# Submitting Pull Requests

We take outside code contributions to `libpmemobj-cpp` through GitHub pull requests.

If you add a new feature or fix a critical bug please append appropriate entry
to ChangeLog under newest release.

**NOTE: If you do decide to implement code changes and contribute them,
please make sure you agree your contribution can be made available under the
[BSD-style License used for libpmemobj-cpp](LICENSE).**

**NOTE: Submitting your changes also means that you certify the following:**

```

# Implementing persistent containers

When developing a persistent container make sure you follow the rules and steps described here.

## Steps

1. Create container implementation.
2. Create doc_snippet(s) and example(s).
3. Add `TEST_<CONTAINER>` CMake option for enabling/disabling container's testing.
4. Add tests (including, if possible, adding new/enabling existing libcxx tests in `tests/external/libcxx`).

## Requirements

* Constructors should check whether the container is being constructed on pmem and within a transaction.
  If not, appropriate exception should be thrown.
* If any operation has to or is not allowed to be called inside of a transaction there should be a proper check for that.
* Operations which modify the entire container (like `operator=`, `clear()`, etc.) should be transactional.
* If any operation inside destructor can fail there should be a separate method like `free_data` or `destroy`.
* Each complex container should have a mechanism for checking layout compatibility.
  One way is to store size of key and value on pmem and compare it with `sizeof(value_type)` after pool reopen.
* Padding should always be explicit.
* If any object from the standard library is being stored on pmem, its size should be verified by `static_assert`.
* Public methods should be documented using doxygen comments.

## Optional features

* `for_each_ptr` method for defragmentation purposes.
* Containers with lower memory overhead (like vector) can implement some heuristic for verifying layout (like comparing `pmemobj_alloc_usable_size` with expected capacity).

# Configuring GitHub fork

To build and submit documentation as an automatically generated pull request,
the repository has to be properly configured.

* [Personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) for GitHub account has to be generated.
  * Such personal access token has to be set in in GitHub repository's
  [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets)
  as `DOC_UPDATE_GITHUB_TOKEN` variable.

* `DOC_UPDATE_BOT_NAME` secret variable has to be set. In most cases it will be
  the same as GitHub account name.

* `DOC_REPO_OWNER` secret variable has to be set. Name of GitHub account,
  which will be target to make an automatic pull request with documentation.
  In most cases it will be the same as GitHub account name.

To enable automatic images pushing to GitHub Container Registry, following variables:

* `CONTAINER_REG` existing environment variable (defined in workflow files, in .github/ directory)
  has to be updated to contain proper GitHub Container Registry address (to forking user's container registry),

* `GH_CR_USER` secret variable has to be set up - an account (with proper permissions) to publish
  images to the Container Registry (tab **Packages** in your GH profile/organization).

* `GH_CR_PAT` secret variable also has to be set up - Personal Access Token
  (with only read & write packages permissions), to be generated as described
  [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token)
  for selected account (user defined in above variable).

# Debugging

Test framework supports debugging under gdb.

* For remote debugging set `GDBSERVER` environment variable, which would be passed as argument to gdbserver
application:

```
GDBSERVER=localhost:4444 ctest -R vector_comp_operators_0_none --output-on-failure
```

* For local debugging in graphical environment using cgdb, set `CGDB` environment variable to `gnome-terminal` or `konsole` accordingly to your setup.
