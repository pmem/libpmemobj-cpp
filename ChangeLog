	* Version 1.7-rc1

	This release introduces new experimental container - persistent
	concurrent hashmap and persistent string with limited functionality.

	Experimental features:
	- persistent concurrent hashmap
	- partial delivery of persistent string (constructores and modifiers)

	Bug fixes:
	- add option to force define IS_TRIVIALLY_COPYABLE
	- mark allocation_flag constructor as explicit
	- add missing include to v.hpp

	* Version 1.6

	This release introduces ctl support, allocation flags, snapshot
	method and new experimental persistent container - vector.

	New features:
	- add support for pmemobj_ctl_set/get/exec
	- expose allocation flags in make_persistent(_atomic)
	- transaction: add snapshot method

	Experimental features:
	- persistent vector container

	Other changes:
	- automatically start transaction inside pmem::obj::experimental::array
	  modifier methods (assignment operators, swap and fill)
	- add const methods for pmem::obj::experimental::array
	- add Valgrind instrumentation support
	- remove experimental const_contiguous_iterator
	- add get with arguments method overload for v

	Bug fixes:
	- throw an exception when dropping pmem lock failed
	- fix crash when previous transaction failed to start
	- fix forwarding parameters to constructor in make_persistent_atomic

	Optimizations:
	- decrease number of persistent_ptr dereferences in
	  make_persistent_array

	* Version 1.5.1

	This release fixes minor bugs and improves documentation.

	Notable changes:
	- fix v swap, assignment operators and constructors
	- change conversion operator from T() to T&() in v<>
	- fix range_snapshotting initialization in array.hpp.
	- fix range_snapshotting_iterator bahaviour for snapshot_size == 0.

	* Version 1.5

	This is the first release of libpmemobj-cpp as a separate project.

	It introduces one persistent container - array, which has std::array
	like interface. Currently it is considered experimental and lives
	in experimental namespace.

	We have also cleaned up some function names that, in retrospect, were
	chosen poorly. Functions with old names are still there but are
	deprecated.

	Experimental features:
	- volatile resides on pmem class
	- persistent array container
