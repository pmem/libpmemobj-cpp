**libpmemobj-cpp** is a C++ binding for **libpmemobj** (a library which is a part of [PMDK collection](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk)).
More implementation details can be found in [include/libpmemobj++/README.md](include/libpmemobj++/README.md).

Latest releases can be found on the ["releases" tab](https://github.com/pmem/libpmemobj-cpp/releases).
Up-to-date support/maintenance status of branches/releases is available on [pmem.io](https://pmem.io/libpmemobj-cpp).

# How to build #

## Requirements: ##
- cmake >= 3.3
- libpmemobj-dev(el) >= 1.9 (https://pmem.io/pmdk/)
- compiler with C++11 support:
	- GCC >= 4.8.1 (C++11 is supported in GCC since version 4.8.1, but it does not support expanding variadic template variables in lambda expressions, which is required to build persistent containers and is possible with GCC >= 4.9.0. If you want to build libpmemobj-cpp without testing containers, use flag TEST_XXX=OFF (separate flag for each container))
	- clang >= 3.3
- for testing and development:
	- valgrind-devel (at best with [pmemcheck support](https://github.com/pmem/valgrind))
	- clang format 9.0
	- perl

## On Linux ##

```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make install
```

#### When developing: ####
```sh
$ ...
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DDEVELOPER_MODE=1 -DCHECK_CPP_STYLE=1
$ ...
$ ctest --output-on-failure
```

#### To build packages ####
```sh
...
cmake .. -DCPACK_GENERATOR="$GEN" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make package
```

$GEN is type of package generator and can be RPM or DEB

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX must be set to a destination were packages will be installed

#### To use with Valgrind ####

In order to build your application with libpmemobj-cpp and
[pmemcheck](https://github.com/pmem/valgrind) / memcheck / helgrind / drd,
Valgrind instrumentation must be enabled during compilation by adding flags:
- LIBPMEMOBJ_CPP_VG_PMEMCHECK_ENABLED=1 for pmemcheck instrumentation,
- LIBPMEMOBJ_CPP_VG_MEMCHECK_ENABLED=1 for memcheck instrumentation,
- LIBPMEMOBJ_CPP_VG_HELGRIND_ENABLED=1 for helgrind instrumentation,
- LIBPMEMOBJ_CPP_VG_DRD_ENABLED=1 for drd instrumentation, or
- LIBPMEMOBJ_CPP_VG_ENABLED=1 for all Valgrind instrumentations (including pmemcheck).

If there are no memcheck / helgrind / drd / pmemcheck headers installed on your
system, build will fail.

## On Windows ##

#### Install libpmemobj via vcpkg ####
```sh
vcpkg install pmdk:x64-windows
vcpkg integrate install
```

```sh
...
cmake . -Bbuild -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64"
        -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=c:/tools/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

msbuild build/ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
```
