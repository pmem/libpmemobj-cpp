## libpmemobj-cpp release steps

This document contains all the steps required to make a new release of libpmemobj-cpp.

\#define $VERSION = current full version (e.g. 1.0.2); $VER = major+minor only version (e.g. 1.0)

Make a release locally:
- for major/minor release:
  - change version of Docker images (IMG_VER) in gha.yml to $VER
  - and change "$FORCE_IMAGE_ACTION" flag for pull-or-rebuild.sh to "rebuild" (in linux job)
- add an entry to ChangeLog, remember to change the day of the week in the release date
  - for major/minor releases mention compatibility with the previous release
- echo $VERSION > .version
- git add .version
- update project's version in top-level CMakeLists.txt
- git commit -a -S -m "common: $VERSION release"
- git tag -a -s -m "Libpmemobj-cpp Version $VERSION" $VERSION

Undo temporary release changes:
- git rm .version && git commit -m "common: git versioning"
- for major/minor release:
  - create stable-$VER branch now: git checkout -b stable-$VER
  - and on **master** branch, change back gha.yml (set IMG_VER to "latest"; and swap "rebuild" to "$FORCE_IMAGE_ACTION" again)

Publish changes:
- for major/minor release:
  - git push upstream HEAD:master $VERSION
  - git checkout stable-$VER && git push upstream stable-$VER:stable-$VER
- for patch release:
  - git push upstream HEAD:stable-$VER $VERSION
  - create PR from stable-$VER to next stable (or master, if release is from the most recent stable branch)

Publish package and make it official:
- go to [GitHub's releases tab](https://github.com/pmem/libpmemobj-cpp/releases/new):
  - tag version: $VERSION, release title: Libpmemobj-cpp Version $VERSION,
    description: copy entry from ChangeLog and format it with no tabs and no characters limit in line
- announce the release on pmem group and on pmem slack channel(s)

Later, for major/minor release:
- update library version in [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/ports/libpmemobj-cpp) - file an inssue for their maintainers
- once gh-pages contains new documentation:
 - add there (in index.md) v.$VER section in Doxygen docs links
 - update "Releases' support status" table (older releases' statuses as well, if needed)
