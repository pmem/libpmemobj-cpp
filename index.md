#### The C++ bindings to libpmemobj

The **C++ bindings** provide a less error prone version of libpmemobj
through the implementation of a pmem-resident property, persistent pointers,
scoped and closure transactions, locking primitives and many others.

Doxygen documentation is available:

* for current [master](./master/doxygen/index.html)
* for [v1.9](./v1.9/doxygen/index.html)
* for [v1.8](./v1.8/doxygen/index.html)
* for [v1.7](./v1.7/doxygen/index.html)
* for [v1.6](./v1.6/doxygen/index.html)
* for [v1.5](./v1.5/doxygen/index.html)

#### Releases' support status

Currently last 3 branches/releases are fully supported. Latest releases can be
seen on the ["releases" tab on the GitHub page](https://github.com/pmem/libpmemobj-cpp/releases).

| Version branch | First release date | Maintenance status |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| stable-1.9 | Jan 31, 2020 | Full |

Possible statuses:
1. Full maintenance:
	* All/most of bugs fixed (if possible),
	* Patch releases issued based on a number of fixes and their severity,
	* Full validation efforts for patch releases, including *long tests* execution,
	* At least one release at the end of the maintenance period,
	* Full support for at least a year since the initial release.
2. Limited scope:
	* Only critical bugs (security, data integrity, etc.) will be backported,
	* Patch versions will be released when needed (based on severity of found issues),
	* Validation of patch releases will include at least public CI (Travis, AppVeyor, GitHub Actions); *long tests* may not be executed,
	* Branch will remain in "limited maintenance" status based on the original release availability in popular distros,
	* Announcement about transition to EOL at least a half year before.
3. EOL:
	* No support,
	* No bug fixes,
	* No official releases.
