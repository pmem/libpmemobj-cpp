# pull-or-rebuild-image.sh - rebuilds the Docker image used in the
#                            current Travis build if necessary.
#
# The script rebuilds the Docker image if:
# 1. the Dockerfile for the current OS version (Dockerfile.${OS}-${OS_VER})
#    or any .sh script in the Dockerfiles directory were modified and committed, or
# 2. "rebuild" param was passed as a first argument to this script.
#
# If the Travis build is not of the "pull_request" type (i.e. in case of
# merge after pull_request) and it succeed, the Docker image should be pushed
# to the Docker Hub repository. An empty file is created to signal that to
# further scripts.
#
# If the Docker image does not have to be rebuilt, it will be pulled from
# the Docker Hub.
