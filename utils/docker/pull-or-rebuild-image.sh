# pull-or-rebuild-image.sh - rebuilds the Docker image used in the
#		current build (if necessary) or pulls it from the Docker Container.
#		Docker image is tagged as described in ./images/build-image.sh,
#		but IMG_VER defaults in this script to "latest" (just in case it's
#		used locally without building any images).
#
# If docker was rebuilt and all requirements are fulfilled (more details in
# push_image function below) image will be pushed to the ${CONTAINER_REG}.
#
# The script rebuilds the Docker image if:
# 1. the Dockerfile for the current OS version (Dockerfile.${OS}-${OS_VER})
#    or any .sh script in the Dockerfiles directory were modified and committed, or
# 2. "rebuild" param was passed as a first argument to this script.
#
# The script pulls the Docker image if:
# 1. it does not have to be rebuilt (based on commited changes), or
# 2. "pull" param was passed as a first argument to this script.
