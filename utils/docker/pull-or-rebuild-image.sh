# pull-or-rebuild-image.sh - rebuilds the Docker image used in the
#                            current Travis build if necessary.
#
# The script rebuilds the Docker image if the Dockerfile for the current
# OS version (Dockerfile.${OS}-${OS_VER}) or any .sh script from the directory
# with Dockerfiles were modified and committed.
#
# If the Travis build is not of the "pull_request" type (i.e. in case of
# merge after pull_request) and it succeed, the Docker image should be pushed
# to the Docker Hub repository. An empty file is created to signal that to
# further scripts.
#
# If the Docker image does not have to be rebuilt, it will be pulled from
# Docker Hub.
