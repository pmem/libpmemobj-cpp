# XXX: Patch the Coverity script.
# Recently, this script regularly exits with an error, even though
# the build is successfully submitted.  Probably because the status code
# is missing in response, or it's not 201.
# Changes:
# 1) change the expected status code to 200 and
# 2) print the full response string.
#
# This change should be reverted when the Coverity script is fixed.
#
# The previous version was:
# curl -s https://scan.coverity.com/scripts/travisci_build_coverity_scan.sh | bash
